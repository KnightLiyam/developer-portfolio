        content: `The capstone project: it's the final academic marathon, and for me, it's been an incredible race. My name is Knight William Dimapilis, and for the past few months, I've had the privilege of being the UI/UX designer and assistant developer for our project, OWNIT. It’s more than just a school assignment; it’s a real-world project for a real client, and it’s completely changed my perspective on what I’m capable of.

From Design to Development
As the UI/UX designer, my main role was to be the user's advocate. This meant making the app easy and enjoyable to use. I fell in love with Figma, using it for everything from sketching wireframes to creating detailed prototypes. I also used Canva and other design tools to bring our vision to life. This hands-on experience taught me that great design is a balance of creativity and solving user problems.

But my journey didn’t stop at design.
I also served as an assistant developer, and this is where my journey took an unexpected turn. I got to work on the front end, and I was instantly hooked on JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I loved seeing my designs transform into a living, breathing application. The challenge of fixing bugs and seeing everything come together filled me with a sense of accomplishment I hadn't felt before. This experience ignited a passion within me, and it's a huge reason why I'm now pushing to become a full-fledged front-end developer.

Running Our Way to Success
Our team's journey wasn’t just about coding and designing. Our unique bonding ritual was what truly kept us going. We would start our mornings with a run together. It sounds simple, but those runs were our most important meetings. We would de-stress, talk about our progress, and solve problems while pounding the pavement. After our run, we’d grab a coffee and have a more formal meeting to discuss our next steps. This routine kept us grounded, cohesive, and ready to tackle any challenge.

Our hard work paid off in a big way during our Capstone 1 presentation. We were recognized as the Best Capstone Presenter among 25 other groups. That moment was a massive confidence booster and a validation of all our effort. It proved that our unique process—combining teamwork, technical skills, and a genuine passion for our project—was the right one. This achievement is a huge reason why I’m so motivated to continue my journey in front-end development.

This capstone project has been so much more than a requirement. It’s been a journey of self-discovery, technical growth, and incredible teamwork. I'm excited to see where the road takes me next.`,
