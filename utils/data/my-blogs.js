      <h1>The Capstone Project — More Than Just a Requirement</h1>

      <p>For every BSIT student, the Capstone Project is the final hurdle before graduation.<br/>
      For me, it became something much bigger — a turning point in how I see myself and my future in tech.</p>

      <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Knight William Dimapilis</strong>. I had the privilege of being both the <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong> and <strong>Assistant Developer</strong> for our project, <em>OWNIT</em>.<br/>
      This wasn’t just another school requirement—it was a real-world project for a real client, and it completely reshaped my perspective on design, development, and teamwork.</p>

      <h2>🎨 From Design to Development</h2>
      <p>As the <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong>, my mission was clear: represent the user’s voice.</p>
      <p>Using tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong>, I created wireframes, prototypes, and polished designs...</p>

      <h2>🏃 Running Toward Success</h2>
      <p>One thing that kept us moving forward—literally—was our morning runs. These weren’t just workouts—they became our “walking meetings.”</p>

      <h2>🏆 A Moment of Validation</h2>
      <p>All the effort paid off when we were recognized as <strong>Best Capstone Presenter</strong> out of 25 groups.</p>

      <h2>🚀 What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>This project wasn’t just about finishing a requirement. It was a journey of self-discovery, technical growth, and collaboration.</p>
