        For every BSIT student, the Capstone Project is the final hurdle before graduation.<br/>
        But for me, it became something far greater — a defining moment that shaped my perspective on technology, teamwork, and my own capabilities.

        Hi, I’m <strong>Knight William Dimapilis</strong>. In our Capstone Project, I took on two key roles: 
        <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong> and <strong>Assistant Developer</strong> for our system, <em>OWNIT</em>.<br/>
        This wasn’t just another requirement, it was a <strong>real-world project for a real client</strong>. 
        The experience challenged me to blend creativity with technical execution, and it pushed me to grow in ways I never expected.

        As the <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong>, my mission was simple but challenging: represent the user’s voice. 
        I designed wireframes, prototypes, and final layouts using <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong>, 
        making sure that every interaction felt intuitive and aligned with our client’s needs.
        On the development side, I supported the team in turning those designs into reality. 
        Collaborating closely with my teammates taught me the importance of communication, 
        iteration, and problem-solving — skills that go far beyond just coding.

   <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-5"> 📂 A Journey of Growth and Creation</h2>

   <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-loose mb-6">
    When I started working on my portfolio, I knew I didn’t just want a simple static site.  
    I wanted something that would challenge me, help me master the fundamentals of <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, and serve as proof of how much I can grow through real projects.
   </p>

<p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-loose mb-8">
  Hi, I’m <strong>Knight William Dimapilis</strong>. I learn faster when I’m building <em>actual projects</em> instead of just following tutorials.  
  That’s why this portfolio became more than just a showcase — it became my playground for experimenting, customizing, and gaining new frontend skills.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🌱 Starting with a Template</h2>
<p class="text-base leading-loose mb-6">
  Since I was a beginner in Next.js, I decided to use a template as my starting point.  
  But I didn’t stop there — I worked hard to customize it and turn it into something that truly reflected my style and skills.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🎨 Customizations I Made</h2>
<p class="text-base leading-loose mb-4">
  I experimented with UI/UX improvements and added interactive elements to make the portfolio unique:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 text-base md:text-lg">
  <li>Added a <strong>typewriter animation</strong> in the hero section.</li>
  <li>Included a fun <strong>404 error Lottiefile animation</strong>.</li>
  <li>Improved <strong>hover effects</strong> for smoother interactions.</li>
  <li>Used <strong>AOS (Animate on Scroll)</strong> for clean scroll animations.</li>
  <li>Enhanced the <strong>Projects Section</strong> with images and a “Visit Project” button.</li>
  <li>Added an image beside my <strong>Certificates Section</strong> for better visuals.</li>
  <li>Created a <strong>Blog Section</strong> to share my progress and passion for frontend development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">📚 Lessons I Learned</h2>
<p class="text-base leading-loose mb-6">
  This project helped me understand the fundamentals of <strong>React components</strong>, <strong>Next.js routing</strong>, and the importance of designing with the <strong>user experience</strong> in mind.  
  Every small customization boosted my confidence as a frontend developer and reinforced my passion for building interactive websites.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🚀 Looking Ahead</h2>
<p class="text-base leading-loose mb-6">
  Even if this portfolio started from a template, it became a reflection of my effort, creativity, and curiosity.  
  This is just the beginning — I’m excited to explore more of Next.js and React, and eventually build fully custom projects from scratch.

        My main tools are <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>,

        One of my favorite ways to work is in <strong>coffee shops</strong>.

        Running helps me clear my thoughts, workouts keep me energized,
