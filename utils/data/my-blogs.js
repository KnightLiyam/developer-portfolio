        For every BSIT student, the Capstone Project is the final hurdle before graduation.<br/>
        But for me, it became something far greater — a defining moment that shaped my perspective on technology, teamwork, and my own capabilities.

        Hi, I’m <strong>Knight William Dimapilis</strong>. In our Capstone Project, I took on two key roles: 
        <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong> and <strong>Assistant Developer</strong> for our system, <em>OWNIT</em>.<br/>
        This wasn’t just another requirement, it was a <strong>real-world project for a real client</strong>. 
        The experience challenged me to blend creativity with technical execution, and it pushed me to grow in ways I never expected.

        As the <strong>UI/UX Designer</strong>, my mission was simple but challenging: represent the user’s voice. 
        I designed wireframes, prototypes, and final layouts using <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong>, 
        making sure that every interaction felt intuitive and aligned with our client’s needs.
        On the development side, I supported the team in turning those designs into reality. 
        Collaborating closely with my teammates taught me the importance of communication, 
        iteration, and problem-solving — skills that go far beyond just coding.

        What kept us going wasn’t just hard work in front of our screens. 
        Our team built habits that strengthened our bond, like morning runs that turned into “walking meetings.”

        All the late nights, brainstorming sessions, and design revisions were worth it when our team was awarded 
        <strong>Best Capstone Presentor</strong> out of 25 groups. 
        Standing in front of the panel and hearing our project recognized as the best was more than just validation — 
        it was proof that teamwork, preparation, and passion pay off.

    Building My Portfolio with Next.js
  </h1>

  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
    When I started working on my portfolio, I knew I didn’t just want a simple static site.  
    I wanted something that would challenge me, help me master the fundamentals of <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, and serve as proof of how much I can grow through real projects.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
    Hi, I’m <strong>Knight William Dimapilis</strong>. I learn faster when I’m building <em>actual projects</em> instead of just following tutorials.  
    That’s why this portfolio became more than just a showcase — it became my playground for experimenting, customizing, and gaining new frontend skills.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🌱 Starting with a Template</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Since I was a beginner in Next.js, I decided to use a template as my starting point.  
    But I didn’t stop there — I worked hard to customize it and turn it into something that truly reflected my style and skills.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🎨 Customizations I Made</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I experimented with UI/UX improvements and added interactive elements to make the portfolio unique:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
    <li>Added a <strong>typewriter animation</strong> in the hero section.</li>
    <li>Included a fun <strong>404 error Lottiefile animation</strong>.</li>
    <li>Improved <strong>hover effects</strong> for smoother interactions.</li>
    <li>Used <strong>AOS (Animate on Scroll)</strong> for clean scroll animations.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the <strong>Projects Section</strong> with images and a “Visit Project” button.</li>
    <li>Added an image beside my <strong>Certificates Section</strong> for better visuals.</li>
    <li>Created a <strong>Blog Section</strong> to share my progress and passion for frontend development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">📚 Lessons I Learned</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    This project helped me understand the fundamentals of <strong>React components</strong>, <strong>Next.js routing</strong>, and the importance of designing with the <strong>user experience</strong> in mind.  
    Every small customization boosted my confidence as a frontend developer and reinforced my passion for building interactive websites.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🚀 Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Even if this portfolio started from a template, it became a reflection of my effort, creativity, and curiosity.  
    This is just the beginning — I’m excited to explore more of Next.js and React, and eventually build fully custom projects from scratch.
